# 👨🏾‍💻 Tebatso Gololo| Aspiring Legal Tech Developer



Hi there 👋🏾, I'm **Tebatso**, a **beginner software developer** currently enrolled at the **FNB App Academy** through **IT varsity**. I come from a legal background and am now on a mission to bridge the gap between **law and technology**.

## ⚖️ From Legal Practice to Legal Tech

I am a **Master of Laws (LLM) candidate**, holding a **Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree** from the University of South Africa (UNISA). I am also currently pursuing a qualification in **Legal Compliance Management** at the University of Johannesburg. I have successfully completed my **Articles of Clerkship** at the UNISA Law Clinic and my **Practical Legal Training** at the Law School of South Africa. My next step is to write the final admission exam to become an **admitted attorney** of the High Court of South Africa.


While working in the legal field, I became increasingly aware of the challenges faced by lawyers and clients alike:
- Missed deadlines resulting in prescribed matters
- Poor record-keeping and unsecured legal files
- Lack of accessible, affordable digital tools for small law firms and solo practitioners

These gaps inspired me to explore **software development**, not to leave legal profession behind, but to **enhance it**, protect its integrity, and **safeguard client rights** through innovation.

## 💡 Why Law + Code?

I believe the future of legal practice lies in embracing responsible technology.

- ⚖️ As a lawyer, I understand the **ethical duties, confidentiality risks, and professional standards** of the legal profession.
- 💻 As a coder, I’m learning how to build **practical, secure, and user-friendly tools** that help legal professionals stay compliant and organized.
- 🚨 My mission is to **protect the profession** and the public by creating systems that **reduce negligence**, **enhance compliance**, and **preserve justice**.

### 🎯 The Vision:
